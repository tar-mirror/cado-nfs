 * Destructors:
 *
 * There is no destructor function for this type. The global assumption
 * is that the mm layer which is fed with this structure has the right to
 * claim ownership of the data referenced from this structure. If it does
 * not, then it is this layer's responsibility to release the memory. In
 * a sense, matmul_build_cache *is* the destructor...
 *
 * To illustrate this, the layer mm_basic reuses (and in fact, also
 * modifies) the m->p data, and thus it remains in memory.  In contrast,
 * the bucket layer discards this data, as the post-processed matrix form
 * is more efficient eventually.
