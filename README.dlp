Using CADO-NFS for DLP in large characteristic fields.
------------------------------------------------------

**** Basic usage: DLP in GF(p)

The cado-nfs.py script can be used to compute discrete logarithms in a
prime field GF(p). For example, to compute the discrete logarithm in GF(p)
modulo the factor 101538509534246169632617439 of p-1 of the target
92800609832959449330691138186 with p=191907783019725260605646959711:

$ ./cado-nfs.py -dlp -ell 101538509534246169632617439 target=92800609832959449330691138186 191907783019725260605646959711

In principle, just typing
  ./cado-nfs.py -dlp -ell <ell> target=<target> <p>
should compute the discrete logarithm of <target> modulo <ell> in
GF(<p>). Right now, there are parameters only for primes p of around 30,
60, 100 or 155 digits (to be checked in params_dl/ subdirectory). If no
target is given, then the output is a file containing the virtual
logarithms of all the factor base elements.

More flexibility is possible. An example of parameter file is given in
parameters/dlp/param.p60. Compared to parameter files for integer
factorization, the main difference is that the lines related
to characters and sqrt disappear and that there is an additional block of
parameters related to individual logarithms.

After the computation is finished, it is possible to run again the
cado-nfs.py script, with a different target: only the last step will be
run. For ensuring that the precomputed data is really used, copy-paste
the command-line indicated in the output of the first computation that
contains "If you want to compute a new targetâ€¦", and set the new target at the
end.

Important note: the logarithms are given in an arbitrary (unknown) base.
If you want to define them with respect to a specific generator g, then
you'll have to compute the logarithm of g and then divide all the logs by
this value.

**** Using non-linear polynomials

Just like for factorization, it is possible to use two non-linear
polynomials for DLP. However, the polynomial selection is not automatic
in that case: the user must provide the polynomial file. Also, the
current descent script will not work.

See README.nonlinear for an example of importing a polynomial file with 2
non-linear polynomials.

An important issue is that since the descent is not yet functional
for this case, the script has no way to check the results if there is no
linear polynomial. A good idea is to set
  tasks.reconstructlog.partial = false
so that many consistency checks are performed while using all the
relations that were deleted during the filter.

**** Discrete logarithms in GF(p^k) for small k

The algorithm works "mutatis mutandis" for discrete logarithm computations
in GF(p^k). The only difference is that the two polynomials must have a
common irreducible factor of degree k over GF(p). Polynomial selection
for this case is not yet included, so you must build them by yourself,
based on constructions available in the literature. Also the individual
logarithm has to be implemented for that case.

For DLP in GF(p^2), things are sligthly more integrated:
  ./cado-nfs.py <p> -dlp -ell <ell> -gfpext 2
should work for p = 7 mod 8, provided that a parameter file is available
for the size of p (at the time of writing this doc, only p of 20 decimal
digits is supported).
