 * macros), which tweak the behaviour of include files. Our intent is to
 * define here in a unique place the required macros exposing the functions
 * we like to have.
 *
 * It is necessary that this file appears only on top of the compilation
 * units, and before any other header. We promise to never include
 * another header file as a side-effect of this one (except
 * cado_config.h, which makes sense to include here as well).
