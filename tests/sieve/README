Some of the tests in this directory check that the siever produces the
same relations as before, for a given set of parameters. This is the case
in particular for F9_sievetest and a few others.

If you ran "make check" on a released version, then the tests should not
fail, and there is probably a geniune bug. However, during the
development, if the test fails for the first time after a modification of
the siever, then here is the recipe:

1- Is your change in the siever supposed to change in any way the
   relations produced for a given set of parameters ?
     No -> it seems that it did change the relations; investigate!

2- Are you sure that the new version of the siever is better than the
   previous one?
     No -> please perform a large number of tests to compare before /
     after, in order to validate the changes.

3- So, the new siever is correct. Now you can edit the shell scripts
   based on the factorization of F9:
     - update the REFERENCE_SHA1 variable (the failed test prints it)
     - update the REFERENCE_REVISION variable: this is the id of the
       commit that created the new SHA1 value.
     - keep track of old values as comments in the script.
     - don't forget to put in comment the number of relation found.

4- Run "make check" again, to verify that now these tests are passed.
   Commit your changes!
